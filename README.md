## Getting Started

This code is based on following libraries:

* `python=3.8`
* `pytorch=1.7.0` (with cuda 10.2)

To create virtual environment with all necessary libraries:
 
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

By default data should be saved under `data/feat/{audio,label,visual}` directory and logs (w/ cache, checkpoint) are saved under `data/{cache,ckpt,log}` directory. Using symbolic link is recommended:

```bash
ln -s {path_to_your_data_directory} data
```

We use single TITAN RTX for training, but GPUs with less memory are still doable with smaller batch size (provided precomputed features).


## Dataset

We plan to release the Pano-AVQA dataset public within this year, including Q&A annotation, precomputed features, etc. Please stay tuned!


## Model

### Training

Default configuration is provided in `code/config.py`. To run with this configuration:

```bash
python cli.py
```

To run with custom configuration, either modify `code/config.py` or execute:

```bash
python cli.py with {{flags_at_your_disposal}}
```

### Inference

Model weight is saved under `./data/log` directory. To run inference only:

```bash
python cli.py eval with ckpt_file=../data/log/{experiment}/{ckpt}.pth
```
